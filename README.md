# T-Rex, Run!

This project is about an automated Chrome Dino who is smart enough to jump over the obsticles (cactus). The Dino is trained using Asynchronous Advanced Actor-Critic algorithm (A3C) from Reinforcement Learning.

## Getting Started

Use any python IDE to open the project. I personally use Spyder from Anaconda.You can download both Anaconda or Spyder from the following links:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) - The Data Science Platform for Python/R
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - The Scientific Python Development Environment

### Installation

Before running the project, type the following command to install the libraries that the project depends on

```
pip install numpy, matplotlib, keras, threading, opencv-contrib-python, gym, gym_chrome_dino, Pillow, selenium, tensorflow-gpu==1.15
```
Or simply type the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

The description of each function is located on top of them. Please read them before running for clarity.

To run the test, go to main.py, and run (Press F5 for most of the IDEs)

## Deployment

Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be applied to any software agents in an environment. One of the best ways for beginners to approach Reinforcement Learning is learning Gym Environment and RL Algorithms. Click the following links to find out more about Reinforcement Learning.
